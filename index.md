# Jonathan Su's Programming Portfolio (2020-2021)

**About**:

Welcome to my programming portfolio! I've done block coding before and found that fascinating, so I wanted to try real coding. My language of focus for my first year was Java, as well as [Processing](processing.org) (similar to Java). I decided to continue to computer programming 2 to learn Java more in depth; I also took the AP Computer Science A exam. My main IDEs were [REPLIT](https://replit.com/) and Eclipse.
